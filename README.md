# BustaBot
My Bustabit script that works together with a custom Telegram bot :)  
Right now, it only shows the profit, but more features coming up!  
Want to make a commit to the repository?  
Great! go ahead!
Want me to keep making the bot better and better?  
Then please send some bits to "FinlayDaG33k" (without the quotes),  
It will help looking for alternative strategies as I don't have to pay all losses myself (and I will lose a lot for sure and I am on a very tigh budget already)  
  
This bot is not build at getting huge profits per game, but rather building it up slow and steadily.  
The bot however, is able to find a baseBet on it's own based on your current balance, it will change it every time you win so that you should get maximum profit!  


# Support
Want to make the bot more powerful? great!  
You can do 3 things to help me in it.
- Make a contribution in code.  
  If you can code, you can help the bot getting more powerful or functional by contibuting to the code.  
  This is ofcourse the hardest way to contibute, but if you know how to code, then why not? :)  
- Run the bot without any AdBlockers.  
  The bot by default injects an invisible ad into the Webpage.
  This ad is insivible to the naked eye and should not bother you.
  This is a way to support the development, while also making profit yourself (if you're lucky enough that is)  
- Make a donation.
  Ofcourse, you can also make a donation :)  
  If you decide to do so, please send your desired amount to "FinlayDaG33k",  
  once I see the donation pop-up in my transfers list, I will add you to the Donators section below! (And it doesn't matter how much you decide to donate!)
