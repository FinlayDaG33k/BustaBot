# BustaBot
My Bustabit script that works together with a custom Telegram bot :)  
Right now, it only shows the profit, but more features coming up!  
Want to make a commit to the repository?  
Great! But please use the `dev` branch for that :)  
Want me to keep making the bot better and better?  
Then please send some bits to "FinlayDaG33k" (without the quotes),  
It will help looking for alternative strategies as I don't have to pay all losses myself (and I will lose a lot for sure and I am on a very tigh budget already)

#Todo
- [ ] Notify the user when a loss-streak happened
- [ ] Notify user if their bot has became in-active
- [x] Update profit calculations (bot doesn't seem to correctly calculate the profit to the Telegram Part)
- [x] Turn off the bot if 4 consecutive losses can't be survived (will show an alert)
- [ ] Add multiple game modes (D'Alembert for example)
- [x] Fix bug where last bet wouldn't get multiplied by 4 to recover loss. (was actually not a bug)
